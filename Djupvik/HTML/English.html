        <h2>Port of Djupvik</h2>

        <p>
          The Port of Djupvik is located on the east coast of Gotland very close to the beautiful smaller island Lilla Karlsö. Adjacent to the port is a small and charming fishing-village which, during summer, comes to life with a relaxed and welcoming buzz.

          Close by and situated with a fantastic view over the port is Djupvik Hotel, with modern standard and with its own popular restaurant.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both the port and the fishing village have a beautiful view of two popular bird islands called “Lilla Karlsö” and “Stora Karlsö”.

          North, and connected to the port, is a small sandy beach which is well soothed for a nice swim.
